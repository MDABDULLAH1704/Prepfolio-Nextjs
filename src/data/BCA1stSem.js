            question: '1. Explain the brief history of the development of computers.',
            answer: 'The development of computers happened in different stages over time.',
            point1: '● Abacus – first counting device used in ancient times.',
            point2: '● Pascal’s Calculator – invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642 to perform addition and subtraction.',

            explanation:
                'Computer ka safar bahut lamba hai — shuru hua simple counting tools se (jaise Abacus) aur aaj AI tak pahunch gaya. Pehle log manual tools use karte the, phir mechanical calculators (Pascal), phir Babbage ne Analytical Engine ka idea diya — jisme memory aur processing ka concept tha. 1940s mein electronic machines (ENIAC) aaye — vacuum tubes se chalne wale bade aur garam computers. Fir transistor, IC, microprocessor aaye aur computers chhote, saste aur powerful ho gaye. Aaj ke computers internet, cloud aur AI se connect hoke bahut intelligent kaam karte hain.',

            explanation:
                'Computer ek system hai jisme hardware (jaise CPU, monitor), software (programs), data, user aur procedures milke kaam karte hain. Hardware physical parts hain, software instructions deta hai; data wo raw input hai jo process hota hai. Iske kuch khas features speed (bahut tez), accuracy (agar input sahi ho to output sahi), storage (bahut saara data store kar sakta hai), automation (once programmed, khud chal jata hai) aur multitasking (ek saath kai kaam) hain. Seedhi baat: hum input dete hain, computer process karke output deta hai — aur ye repeat, reliable aur fast hota hai.',

            point6: '● No IQ – cannot take decisions on its own.',
            point7: '● Dependency – depends on human instructions.',
            point8: '● No Feeling – has no emotions or creativity.',
            explanation:
                'Computer bahut tez aur accurate hai — complex calculations seconds mein kar deta hai, aur bhari data ko store karke rakhta hai. Ye boring, repetitive kaam bina thake kar lega (diligence) aur ek machine se bahut tasks kar sakta hai (versatility). Lekin uske kuch limits bhi hain: usme apna dimaag ya feelings nahi hote — wo decisions khud nahi le sakta; sirf wahi karega jo program ya user bolega (GIGO ka rule). Kabhi creativity, moral judgement ya common-sense decisions lena human ka kaam hai; hardware fail ho sakta hai, maintenance chahiye aur kabhi kabhi cost bhi high hoti hai.',

            point6: '● Hybrid – used in hospitals and research labs.',
            explanation:
                'Analog computers continuous signals (jaise temperature, speed) ke saath kaam karte hain — result ko graph ya needle se dikhate hain. Digital computers discrete values (0 aur 1) use karte hain — ye exact numbers aur logic operations mein best hain (jaise PC, calculator). Hybrid computers dono ka combination hote hain — pehle sensor analog reading leta hai, fir digital part us data ko process karta hai; isliye hospitals aur scientific labs mein use hote hain. Simple: continuous → analog, discrete → digital, dono mix → hybrid.',

            point4: '● Special Purpose – not flexible, limited function.',
            explanation:
                'General-purpose computers flexible hote hain — ek hi machine pe alag-alag programs chal sakte hain (typing, browsing, coding). Special-purpose computers ek hi kaam ke liye banaye jaate hain — wo task bahut efficiently karte hain par dusra kaam nahi kar sakte (jaise ATM sirf banking transactions ke liye). Socho: general-purpose ek Swiss Army knife jaisa (bahut tools), special-purpose ek chaku jaisa jo ek kaam bahut achha karta hai.',

            point2: '● Minicomputer – medium size, used in small organizations.',
            point3: '● Mainframe – handles large data, used in banks and airlines.',
            point4: '● Supercomputer – extremely fast, used for scientific research.',
            explanation:
                'Microcomputer (PC/laptop) personal use ke liye — chhota, affordable aur user-friendly. Minicomputer thoda bada aur multi-user support karta — chhote businesses mein use hota. Mainframe bahut bade organizations (banks, airlines) ke liye — heavy data processing aur bahut saare users simultaneously handle karta. Supercomputer sabse powerful — scientific simulations, weather forecasting, nuclear calculations jaise bahut complex problems ko solve karta hai. In short: size aur power badhne se用途 (use) bhi specialized hota hai.',

            explanation:
                'Desktop: fixed setup, zyada power aur upgrade options, ghar/office ke liye best. Laptop: portable, battery-powered, travel-friendly, thoda kam upgradeable. Notebook: laptop se halka aur slim — basic tasks ke liye. Palmtop: pocket-sized (old PDAs), basic organizing tasks; aaj smartphones ne inki jagah le li. Workstation: professionals ke liye high-performance PC — heavy graphics, CAD, 3D rendering ke liye. Har type ka trade-off hota hai between portability, performance aur price.',
