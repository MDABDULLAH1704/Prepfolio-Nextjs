            question: '5. What is Inheritance? Explain its importance with an example.',
            answer: 'Inheritance allows one class to use properties and behaviors of another class. It helps in code reusability.',
            point1: '● Base class – The class whose properties are inherited.',
            point2: '● Derived class – The class that inherits from the base class.',
            point3: '● Promotes code reusability and extension.',

            explanation: 'Inheritance ek aisa concept hai jisme ek class (child class) doosri class (parent class) ke features le sakti hai. Jaise Dog class ne Animal class ke eat() function ko use kar liya bina naya likhe. Isse code chhota aur reuse hone layak banta hai.'

            question: '6. What is Polymorphism in C++? Explain types of polymorphism with examples.',
            answer: 'Polymorphism means one name many forms. It allows the same function to behave differently based on input or object.',

            question: '8. What are Preprocessor Directives in C++? Explain with suitable examples.',
            answer: 'Preprocessor directives are instructions given to the compiler before compilation starts.',

            explanation: 'Directives compiler ko batate hain ki program start hone se pehle kya include karna hai. Jaise #include se iostream file add hoti hai jisme cout, cin jaise features hote hain. #define se hum constant value set karte hain.'

            answer: 'setw() is used to set the width of the output field for better formatting of data.',
            point1: '● It aligns output properly in tabular format.',

            explanation: 'setw() output ko properly align karne ke liye use hota hai. Jaise agar hum table format me roll number aur name print karna chahte hain to setw() use karke column spacing fix kar sakte hain. Ye output ko professional look deta hai.'
