                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    At <strong>Prepfolio</strong>, we aim to provide high-quality PDF notes, practice questions, and audio lessons
                    to help students learn effectively. Please read this Refund & Cancellation Policy carefully before

                <h3>2. Digital Product Nature</h3>
                <p>
                    All products and materials available on Prepfolio are digital in nature. Once a course or content has been
                    purchased and accessed (viewed, downloaded, or listened to), it is considered delivered and non-refundable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users are therefore advised to review course details, previews, and descriptions carefully before purchasing.

            <section>
                <h3>3. No Refund After Access</h3>
                <p>Since the content is instantly accessible after payment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not provide refunds, returns, or exchanges once access to the course or content is granted.</li>
                    <li>
                        Refund requests for reasons such as ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like the content,‚Äù ‚Äúpurchased by mistake,‚Äù or ‚Äúchanged my mind‚Äù
                        will not be accepted.

                <p>
                    Since digital products are delivered instantly, course purchases cannot be canceled once payment is completed.

                <p>
                    Users can choose to stop using the platform at any time, but this does not qualify for a refund.
